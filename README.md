# Image classifier

Classifying an object image that you want from all other images. Implementation of codes are done from literal scratch without deep learning frameworks such as Tensorflow and Keras.


HOW TO USE IT ON YOUR COMPUTER?

* You only need to change the directory to your personal one *

1. Go to my google drive to download the datasets:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=12oIU2uCpO8LjkqC3WaQ1k1dB-WGCZmdg

2. Take note of your directory, go to resizing.py and resize the images.

3. After resizing the images, transfer the resized images into two different files (one for the image you want to detect and one for other images). You can search the images within the file (Go to the search bar -> type: resizing_new) All your resized image will appear, now transfer it to a new file.

4. Now you can run the NN_Final.py script and it will compute all of the parameters required. Remember to change the directory of the input data to your resized image file!

5. Try it out with your own images or use the images in test_your_images to see whether is the AI working! Run test_your_image.py after you are finished running NN_Final.py

6. Tune the NN_Final yourself and see whether can you get better testing accuracy!

Note: You will need to have Pillow, NumPy, OpenCV , matplotlib libraries installed on your computer.

# image_classifier
Classifying an object image that you want from all other images


HOW TO USE IT ON YOUR COMPUTER?

* You only need to change the directory to your personal one *

1. Go to my google drive to download the datasets:

2. Take note of your directory, go to resizing.py and resize the images.

3. After resizing the images, put the resized images into two different files (one for the image you want to detect and one for other images)

4. Now you can run the NN_Final.py script and it will compute all of the parameters required!

5. Try it out with your own images or use the images in test_your_images to see whether is the AI working! Run test_your_image.py

6. Tune the NN_Final yourself and see whether can you get better testing accuracy!
